# QuickConverter
A java program with an interactive user friendly interface meant for quick and efficient conversion of dollar, euro or pound currencies to Kenyan currency. 
Its functionality lies in it's simplicity. For now only kenyan currency is supported, but later version will allow you to choose which currency to convert to.

# Application design
The Application saves its currency values in a folder called "Converter Application" in the Documents folder.
If for some reason this folder is deleted, or it is the first time it is running, Quick Converter will recreate that folder when it boots up and set the default currency rates.
Elsewise it displays the welcome screen below.(Which can be disabled in the File menu).
